    \begin{column}{.6\textwidth}

      %% The duration of this talk could easily be for a couple of hours, but
      %% since we only have 15 minutes, let's try to narrow the solution space to
      %% APIs and customer needs.

      \textbf{What do customers want?} Let's consider two kinds of customers
      who might want APIs:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item{Those who want to automate repetitive workflows.}
      \item{Those who need low-level access to the underlying libraries and
        components that make up an Ansys product.}
      \end{itemize}

      %% Companies used to spend a huge part of their resources in employees
      %% manually configuring and running simulations. Nowadays, most customers
      %% want to automate this process, such that by easily modifying an
      %% automated script they can rerun their simulations and evaluate the
      %% impact of these changes.

      %% Automation is a key point - having a person "behind the wheel" is
      %% sometimes necessary but once you have proven that your automation
      %% tools work, they are less error prone.

      \textbf{What do developers want?}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item{Well documented low-level interface to foreign libraries to avoid
        duplicating work.}
      \end{itemize}

      %% Developers use APIs all the time. These are the public interfaces that
      %% enable other developers to use their libraries.

\subsection{Definition}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{API Definition}

  API stands for ``Application Programming Interface'' and is a set of
  functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access
  the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

  %% Idea of an API predates the term itself!
  %%
  %% In 1948 British computer developers of the early computer EDSAC. Stored
  %% subroutines for libraries on punched paper tape organized in a filing
  %% cabinet.
  %%
  %% This cabinet also contained what Wilkes and Wheeler called a
  %% "library catalog" of notes about each subroutine and how to incorporate it
  %% into a program.
  %%
  %% Today, such a catalog would be called an API (or an API
  %% specification or API documentation) because it instructs a programmer on
  %% how to call each subroutine.

  \begin{examples}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A C header file
    \item Public Python class function
    \item HTTP POST Request Method
    \end{itemize}
  \end{examples}

  In essence, APIs let the users know how to interact with a given library or
  network interface without containing the specifics of the implementation.

  \frametitle{Ansys's API - A Holistic Overview}

  To address the need for product automation and low-level access, we need to
  expose three types of APIs:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Core service/library APIs
      \item Product automation APIs
      \item Remote product APIs
    \end{itemize}

    These three levels of APIs ensure Ansys can enable:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Inter-product communication without writing to disk
      \item Product customization and automation
      \item Compatibility with cloud infrastructure (e.g. \href{https://www.docker.com/}{Docker})
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Consider two types of Remote APIs:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{Inter-product communication: Use an architecture designed to allow
      the manipulation and exchange of information between multiple
      technologies and componentized software
      components. The \href{https://grpc.io/}{gRPC framework} works well for this
      scenario.}
    \item{Web APIs: Use an architecture designed for the interaction of
       physically separate components. \href{https://restfulapi.net/}{REST} is
       an ideal architectural style given its stateless, cacheable nature.}
    \end{itemize}
  \item The choice of the underlying architecture and technology must be driven
    by the problem and there is no ``one size fits all'' solution.
